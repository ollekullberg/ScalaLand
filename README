Scala Land

This is an example application written in Scala. You have to use SBT to build it.

The application grows from nothing into a more and more complex application. You should start with the code in these packages:

  src/main/scala/com/programmera/scalaland1
  src/main/scala/com/programmera/scalaland2
  src/main/scala/com/programmera/scalaland3
  ...

The scalaland_func packages use more realistic scala code, with closures and the like: 

  src/main/scala/com/programmera/scalaland_func1
  src/main/scala/com/programmera/scalaland_func2
  src/main/scala/com/programmera/scalaland_func3
  ...
  src/main/scala/com/programmera/scalaland_func_final

Then you can check out the Akka solution (builds upon scalaland_func_final):

  src/main/scala/com/programmera/scalaland_akka1
  ...

The Lift solution then builds upon the Akka solution:

  src/main/scala/com/programmera/scalaland_lift1
  ...
