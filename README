Scala Land

This is an example application written in Scala. You have to use SBT to build it.

The application grows from noting into a more and more complex application. You should read the code from:

src/main/scala/com/programmera/scalaland1
src/main/scala/com/programmera/scalaland2
src/main/scala/com/programmera/scalaland3
...
src/main/scala/com/programmera/scalaland_func1
src/main/scala/com/programmera/scalaland_func3
src/main/scala/com/programmera/scalaland_func4
...

Then you can see how the Akka solution builds upon this code OR see the Lift solution.
