Scala Land

This is an example application written in Scala. You have to use SBT to build it.

The application grows from nothing into a more and more complex application. You should start with the code in these packages:

  src/main/scala/com/programmera/scalaland1
  src/main/scala/com/programmera/scalaland2
  src/main/scala/com/programmera/scalaland3
  src/main/scala/com/programmera/scalaland4

Next step is to introduce traits:

  src/main/scala/com/programmera/scalaland_trait

The scalaland_immutable packages employ immutable objects to construct a solution similar to the scalaland_trait solution. The code has closures and the like: 

  src/main/scala/com/programmera/scalaland_immutable1
  src/main/scala/com/programmera/scalaland_immutable2
  src/main/scala/com/programmera/scalaland_immutable3
